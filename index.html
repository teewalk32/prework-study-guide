        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are alawys defined in beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines matadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS style associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the external resource to the HTML.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening and closing tag.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of elements.</li>
          <li>The a element stands for anchor.</li>
          <li>The a element creates a link to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <section class=" card" id="css-section">
          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS needs to be linked to HTML file for the code to be visible on website.</li>
          <li>The link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and linked resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS; inline CSS, CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. </li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property ads shadow effects around an elements frame.</li>
          <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class '.card', will gain  property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Git commit -m to commit stagged files.</li>
          <li>Git clone clones the remote repository into 2 places.</li>
          <li>The git default branch is named main.</li>
          <li>You can create a feature by branching off the main.</li>
          <li>Git add can add a file directly as it looks to your next commit.</li>
          <li>Git diff is whats changed but not stagged.</li>
          <li>Git diff --staged is whats stagged but not yet committed.</li>
          <li>Git merge is where you megrge specific branch history into a current one.</li>
          <li>Git log shows all commits in the current branch history.</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of different versions of the project.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with 'git'.</li>
          <li>Git commands are not the same as bash commands such as 'cd' and 'mkdir' .</li>
          <li>Git is tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to do collaborating projects with others youll need to use a Git-based repository hosting service.</li>
          <li>Git-based repository services are GitHub, Bitbucket, and SourceForge.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>For something to be a string it has to be surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A boolean is a true or false value. The words true and false are special keywords that dont need qoutes around them.</li>
          <li>In javaScript language an array has an index as 0 instead of 1 which means the first array will always start with zero.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it. </li>
          <li>Put /* before and */ after the block of code to comment out.</li>

          <li>After declaring a variable you can give it a vaule.</li>
          <lil>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code.</lil>
          <li>To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
          <li>An array is a structure that allows you to store mulitiple values in asingle reference.</li>
          <li>An object can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in varible.</li>
          <li>Assignments (=) assigns a value to a variable.</li>
          <li>Strict equality (===) performs a test to see if two vaules are equal. it returns a true/false (boolean) result.</li>
