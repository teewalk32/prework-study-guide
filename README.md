# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description


This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.This project contains notes that will help understand each language as well as how write them and how to write commands. When you open DevTools console you can see JavaScript running. It will list topics to study first. Getting a career platform that'll challenge me mentally and something that'll be a better career to support my family is what motivated me the most to get this project completed.I completed this project to help new students get more knowledge before they start bootcamp school so they can start with having an idea on how web development works. This website will help students that never did coding study the basics with everything all on one webpage. You'll learn HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript on this webpage.
